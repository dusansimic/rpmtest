# rpmtest

A simple script for testing rpm specs.

## Why?

I wanted to make testing my rpm spec files easier. This script automatest starting, setting up and
stopping a container that will build the rpm package. It's very opinionated and it has very little
error handling so it stays small.

I don't plan to extend it or make it support more things. If you wan't to extend it, make a fork.
